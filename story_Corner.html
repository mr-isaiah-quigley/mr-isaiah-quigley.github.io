    <h1>Story Corner</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my story corner!  Below you will find my creative library.  Included are short stories, poems, and other creative works of mine.  Some day, I hope to release a novel or two, chapter by chapter.  This may become "blog like" as I release posts weekly and my posts are arranged chronologically.  For now, they shall be alphabetical until I see where this truly goes.  Enjoy!</p>
